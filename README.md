I developed a simple Library Management System in Python as a practical exercise to reinforce my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. 
This project simulates the basic functionalities of a library system, enabling users to manage book records efficiently. Members can borrow and return books 
and search for specific titles within the library's collection.

>Features

-Book Management:
Add New Books: Add new books to the library's inventory, including details such as title, author, and ISBN.
Remove Books: Remove books from the inventory based on the book title.

-Lending System:
Borrow Books: Lend books to users by updating the availability status.
Return Books: Update the status of returned books to make them available for other users.

-Search Functionality:
Search Books: Allow users to search for books by title, author, or ISBN.

-File Handling:
Persistent Storage: Use CSV files to store and manage book records, ensuring data persistence between sessions.
Data Integrity: Maintain data integrity by accurately reading from and writing to CSV files, including handling headers and ensuring correct data format.

Key OOP Concepts Applied
Classes and Objects: Implemented classes for book, library and member.
Inheritance: Implemented single-level inheritance.
File I/O: Utilized file handling techniques to read from and write to CSV files, demonstrating real-world data management skills.
Still working to add more concepts like encapsulation etc. 

Feel free to contribute!
